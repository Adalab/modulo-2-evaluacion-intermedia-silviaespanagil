# Javascript: Intermediate evaluation for Adalab
## _Guess the number_
¡Hola!

This last weeks I've been learning some Javascript and this is my first attempt on something real using a couple of functions and events ✨

## Requirements 📋

- Small and simple HTML
- A random number between 1 to 100 must be generated only once
- The user number guess must be between 1 to 100
- In the clue box the user will find if his guess is to low or high
- If the user guess is correct a congratulations message will appear.
- There is a counter of how many times the user has tried to guess the number.

## Tech 💻
Nothing fancy, three simple files: HTML, CSS and JS

### Built with 🔨
- Visual Code Studio: as code editor
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Development ⌨️

For this project I started building the form HTML with some styles. After it I went in with the functions and events.

First of all I wrote in a paper the user story so I could see the needed functions clearer. I started doing the random number event. I wanted it to be generated as the user loaded the page so it wouldn't generate again in the click event.

After it I went to the handler function that consist in a numberValidator function and the counter.
